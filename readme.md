# Offensive Language Classification/Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on the application of machine learning techniques and neural networks to classify and detect offensive words or language in text. The primary goal is to develop a solution that can automatically identify and flag content containing offensive language.

Offensive language can be pervasive in various online platforms, social media, and text-based communication channels. Detecting and filtering offensive content is crucial for maintaining a positive and respectful online environment. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and neural networks, we aim to create a robust and efficient system capable of identifying offensive language and taking appropriate actions.

## Methodology
The project involves implementing various machine learning algorithms and neural network architectures to train models that can accurately classify offensive language. The dataset used for training consists of labeled examples containing both offensive and non-offensive text samples. By analyzing the characteristics and patterns of offensive language, the models learn to differentiate between offensive and non-offensive content.

To preprocess the text data, we utilize libraries such as NLTK for tokenization, stemming, and removing stopwords. This helps in converting the raw text into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms. Additionally, we leverage techniques such as word embedding, TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), and feature extraction to enhance the model's understanding of the underlying context.

The machine learning models employed in this project include Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier. These models are trained on the preprocessed data to learn the relationship between the input text and offensive language. Evaluation metrics like F1 score and confusion matrix are utilized to assess the models' performance and fine-tune them for better results.

Furthermore, neural network architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), are explored to capture intricate patterns and dependencies in the text data. Deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch are used to build, train, and evaluate these neural network models. By leveraging the power of neural networks, we aim to achieve even higher accuracy in offensive language classification.
